## 1. Project with AppLifecycleState

Path: `piyush/flutter01/`

This Flutter project demonstrates handling app lifecycle events using `WidgetsBindingObserver` and `AppLifecycleState`.

### Features:
- Detects app lifecycle changes: `resumed`, `paused`, `inactive`, `detached`
- Can be used to pause/resume media, save app state, and more.

---

## Next Step:
Will add another version **without AppLifecycleState** soon.
